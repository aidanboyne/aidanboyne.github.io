MATLAB Code
---
An (incomplete) list of some MATLAB code I've written for numerical analysis and optimization classes, along with some for personal projects:

Golden Seach - Efficient line search which always converges on minimum in region
[Download][1]

Many-Dimensional Newton's Method - Newton's method for n-dimensional search space
[Download][2]

Gaussian Quadrature - Definite integral approximation with 2nd and 3rd degree polynomials
[Download][3]

Bezier Curve - Constructs and plots Bezier curve with given endpoint and guidepoints
[Download][4]

Biomechanics Reports
---
While studying in Sweden, I wrote the following reprots detailing the biomechanical properties of rat bone and tendon. I really enjoyed the work and am proud of the results, viewable [_here (bone)_][5], and [_here (tendon)_][6]
