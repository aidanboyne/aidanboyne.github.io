Welcome! This is a website where I write and post about interesting stuff, academic and otherwise. If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, send me an email at aidanboyne@gmail.com. 

Apartments of Westwood
------
Westwood is a community in Los Angeles surrounding UCLA. As the school and grew, apartments with all sorts of architectual styles were built to accomodate students, faculty, and other members of the community. I take pictures of my favorite apartments and post them here.

Academics
------
For employers or for anyone who is interested, my academic projects and a CV are linked above. I'm currently in my fourth year studying bioengineering and math at UCLA. I especially enjoy working with biomechanics, biological control systems, and applied numerical methods. I've included some simple but potentially helpful code (MATLAB and Jupyter Notebook). Feel free to use it or improve it!

State Beach
------
A band formed by Zach Taylor. I play guitar and keys. Linnea Jackson sings and plays bass, John Gallagher is on guitar, Matthew McGrath plays keys, and Zach sings and plays guitar. We might be playing soon! Check out the main page linked at the top.

Statistics of Sailing (and other things)
------
As the unoffical data analytics chair of sailing, I do some unofficial data analysis. The results are here along with any other things I've done resulting in nice looking graphs!

Writing
------
Some short essays and Haikus that I wrote.
