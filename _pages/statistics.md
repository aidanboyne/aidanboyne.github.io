**Placement Metric**: Each regatta is ranked from 0 to 1. 1 represents a perfect races and 0 represents the worst races possible.
**Best Boat Lead**: The hue of the points gives a feel for how well our best boat placed in the regatta (the darker the better).
**Last Boat Trail**: Likewise, the size of the points indicates how well our last boat placed (the bigger the better).
