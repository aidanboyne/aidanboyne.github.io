Summary of the UCLA sailing team's performance over the past 13 years. All data is taken from [scores.collegesailing.org](https://scores.collegesailing.org/) and is updated as of Spring 2022.


**Placement Metric**: Each regatta is ranked from 0 to 1. 1 represents a set of perfect races while 0 represents the worst races possible. <br>
**Best Boat Lead**: The hue of the points gives a feel for how well our best boat placed in the regatta (the darker the better). <br>
**Last Boat Trail**: Likewise, the size of the points indicates how well our last boat placed (the bigger the better). <br>
