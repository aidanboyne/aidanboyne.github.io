I spend a lot of time walking around the apartments near UCLA and really appreciate their design. My mom collects old cameras so I asked her to borrow one and
used it to take these pictures. Although most of them are from Westwood, I threw in a couple of my favorites from the nearby area as well.

Was visiting some friends in Santa Barbara and saw this rip in a wall in a parking garage.
