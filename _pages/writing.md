Haikus
------
“Whirr”, the grinder goes <br>
The delightful smell of beans <br>
Wakes me up softly

Exterminator <br>
A sad day to be a bug <br>
Sulfuryl fluoride

Turn on the TV <br>
You sit a little closer <br>
My eyelids heavy

A girl with a dog <br>
Sitting so high on her chair <br>
No doubt, lost to me

Algos pequeños <br>
Visión grandiosa <br>
Esperándome

She has dreams about <br>
Acid rain and climate change <br>
The freedom of sleep

_I wrote these four waiting for customers to leave long after the bar had already closed_

1. String lights hang, heavy <br>
   In the stale air I breathe <br>
   A dull, glowing fog

2. Welcome overstayed <br>
   Their crumpled sheets remind me <br>
   I want them to go

3. A skin so fragile <br>
   Cut by the slip of a glass <br>
   When? Nobody knows

4. Grey hair falling down <br>
   Forgotten and swept away, <br>
   It’s bound to happen

Quiero un amo <br>
Árboles, Canciones <br>
Alguien conmigo

Fingerpicking ninths <br>
Up and across really cold <br>
Gum makes me nauseous

No time for small talk <br>
Big moves, big money, real thoughts <br>
Tick tock goes the clock

Badminton Racquets <br>
Broken strings and a torn net <br>
Serve it over… Let.

Starting the golf cart was an art. You had to hit the gas just right after pushing it down the hill to get the engine going. Driving it past the pro shop and parked cars long after dark. Past the garden and the graveyard to the giant dumpsters. We would stand by the plywood floorboard covering the pothole that turned into a huge puddle when it rained. Throwing the trash bags. My bags would be filled with glass from the bar. So heavy that the bag would tear and shattered glass would pepper the metal dumpster walls. Cooper or Connor would try to throw it from too far and we’d have to pick up all the garbage that spilled out onto the ground...
