Haikus
------
Algos pequeños <br>
Visión grandiosa <br>
Esperándome

She has dreams about <br>
Acid rain and climate change <br>
The freedom of sleep

Quiero un amo <br>
Árboles, Canciones <br>
Alguien conmigo

Fingerpicking ninths <br>
Up and across really cold <br>
Gum makes me nauseous

No time for small talk <br>
Big moves, big money, real thoughts <br>
Tick tock goes the clock

_I wrote the next four waiting for customers to leave long after the bar had already closed_

String lights hang, heavy <br>
In the stale air I breathe <br>
A dull, glowing fog

Welcome overstayed <br>
Their crumpled sheets remind me <br>
I want them to go

A skin so fragile <br>
Cut by the slip of a glass <br>
When? Nobody knows

Grey hair falling down <br>
Forgotten and swept away, <br>
It’s bound to happen

Badminton Racquets <br>
Broken strings and a torn net <br>
Serve it over… Let.

“Whirr”, the grinder goes <br>
The delightful smell of beans <br>
Wakes me up softly

Exterminator <br>
A sad day to be a bug <br>
Sulfuryl fluoride

Turn on the TV <br>
You sit a little closer <br>
My eyelids heavy

A girl with a dog <br>
Sitting so high on her chair <br>
No doubt, lost to me
