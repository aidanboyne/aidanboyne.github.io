Haikus
------
<font size="2">  
Algos pequeños <br>
Visión grandiosa <br>
Esperándome

She has dreams about <br>
Acid rain and climate change <br>
The freedom of sleep

Quiero un amo <br>
Árboles, Canciones <br>
Alguien conmigo

Fingerpicking ninths <br>
Up and across really cold <br>
Gum makes me nauseous

No time for small talk <br>
Big moves, big money, real thoughts <br>
Tick tock goes the clock

_I wrote the next four waiting for customers to leave long after the bar had already closed_

String lights hang, heavy
In the stale air I breathe
A dull, glowing fog

Welcome overstayed
Their crumpled sheets remind me
I want them to go

A skin so fragile
Cut by the slip of a glass
When? Nobody knows

Grey hair falling down
Forgotten and swept away,
It’s bound to happen

Badminton Racquets	
Broken strings and a torn net
Serve it over… Let.

“Whirr”, the grinder goes
The delightful smell of beans
Wakes me up softly

Exterminator
A sad day to be a bug
Sulfuryl fluoride

Turn on the TV
You sit a little closer
My eyelids heavy

A girl with a dog
Sitting so high on her chair
No doubt, lost to me
