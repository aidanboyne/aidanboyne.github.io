Haikus
------
“Whirr”, the grinder goes <br>
The delightful smell of beans <br>
Wakes me up softly

Exterminator <br>
A sad day to be a bug <br>
Sulfuryl fluoride

Turn on the TV <br>
You sit a little closer <br>
My eyelids heavy

A girl with a dog <br>
Sitting so high on her chair <br>
No doubt, lost to me

Algos pequeños <br>
Visión grandiosa <br>
Esperándome

She has dreams about <br>
Acid rain and climate change <br>
The freedom of sleep

Quiero un amo <br>
Árboles, Canciones <br>
Alguien conmigo

Fingerpicking ninths <br>
Up and across really cold <br>
Gum makes me nauseous

No time for small talk <br>
Big moves, big money, real thoughts <br>
Tick tock goes the clock

Badminton Racquets <br>
Broken strings and a torn net <br>
Serve it over… Let.

_I wrote these four waiting for customers to leave long after the bar had already closed_

1. String lights hang, heavy <br>
   In the stale air I breathe <br>
   A dull, glowing fog

2. Welcome overstayed <br>
   Their crumpled sheets remind me <br>
   I want them to go

3. A skin so fragile <br>
   Cut by the slip of a glass <br>
   When? Nobody knows

4. Grey hair falling down <br>
   Forgotten and swept away, <br>
   It’s bound to happen
