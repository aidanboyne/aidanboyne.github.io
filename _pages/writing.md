Haikus
------
Algos pequeños
Visión grandiosa
Esperándome

She has dreams about
Acid rain and climate change
The freedom of sleep

Quiero un amo
Árboles, Canciones
Alguien conmigo

Fingerpicking ninths
Up and across really cold
Gum makes me nauseous

No time for small talk
Big moves, big money, real thoughts
Tick tock goes the clock

_I wrote the next four waiting for customers to leave long after the bar had already closed_

String lights hang, heavy
In the stale air I breathe
A dull, glowing fog

Welcome overstayed
Their crumpled sheets remind me
I want them to go

A skin so fragile
Cut by the slip of a glass
When? Nobody knows

Grey hair falling down
Forgotten and swept away,
It’s bound to happen

Badminton Racquets	
Broken strings and a torn net
Serve it over… Let.

“Whirr”, the grinder goes
The delightful smell of beans
Wakes me up softly

Exterminator
A sad day to be a bug
Sulfuryl fluoride

Turn on the TV
You sit a little closer
My eyelids heavy

A girl with a dog
Sitting so high on her chair
No doubt, lost to me
